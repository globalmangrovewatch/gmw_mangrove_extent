# GMW Mangrove Extent

A repo for tracking issues, documenting and discussing the GMW extent layers

When an issue with the mangrove extent in any of the GMW layer is identified please create an 'issue' and include the following information:

 * Which version and year of the GMW extent dataset (e.g., v2.0 1996, or v3.0 2020, or v4.0 dev0001)
 * What is the location(s)? At a minimum provide a lon/lat but if possible please attach a vector layer (i.e., GeoJSON, Shapefile or KML)
 * Description of the issue - over classification, under classification, habitat mask needs refined.
 * Screenshot of issue from GIS or GoogleEarth might also be useful. 
 * Any other information which could be helpful - for example is it an area you know well and have field photos in which case a photo and/or description of the mangrove type (i.e., height and cover) would be useful.
